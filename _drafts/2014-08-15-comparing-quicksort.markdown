category: programming
---

Catchphrase - Why is Quicksort so slow in Python but order of magnitude faster in Go?

1. Mentioning working through Bentley's Programming Pearls.
1. Code for Lamuto's quicksort with Python
1. Surprised it takes so long.
1. Try it out in Go. Order of magnitude faster.
1. Profiling both code.
1. Timing just the quicksort part.
1. Comparing built-in sort.
1. Lessons learned.
