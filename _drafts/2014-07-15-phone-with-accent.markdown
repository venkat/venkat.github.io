title: My Android phone speaks with an Indian accent
category: technology
---

I am Indian and have a thick accent. Indian accent might be hilarious but it is my accent! I am quite comfortable with my thick rrrrrs. Thank you very much, "we are like this only". :)

In case you didn't know, there are multiple variations of the accent and it is quite easy to identify which region you come from from the accent if you know what you are looking for. I personally think the Keralite accent is the best. They have a distinctive way of pronouncing "O".

Imagine my surprise, when I, by accident found out not only does my android phone understand my accent but it speaks back with my accent! And you could configure it for your accent too. First off, a demo that made my friends (Indian and non-Indian) burst out with laughter.

This feature is built-in to your android phone and it is easy to setup. Now I have this setup, I find myself speaking to my phone a lot. I ask it to set me reminders, find directions, find out what song I am listening to, call people and of course play songs. If you ask it for "google now voice commands" it lists a bunch of sample things you can say to your phone.

This is far from perfect though. It gets confused when I say the name of any Italian or French restaurant or anything very detailed or complicated. For the things it works for, it works very well, even in reasonably noisy environments like a car travelling in a highway.

Here's how you can set it up for your english accent. There are tons of other options available for various language/accent combos:

1. Go to Google Now on your phone.
2. Scroll to the bottom and tap on the "three dots" to open Settings.
3. Tap on Voice

4. Tap on Language and tap on English and it opens up all the accents. This is hidden so deep that I suspect most people would not get to it easily.

5. Make sure you have Speech output on.

Go forth and enjoy a fine conversation if your now non-native english speaking phone.
