I was very impressed seeing David Foster Wallace's [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhhC_N6Bm_s) to Kenyon College's 2005 graduating class. It got me thinking about my own experiences with "default setting" as he calls it - your spontaneous thought process when you are in a particular situation and the need to be able to control it by actually choosing how you think about it. The aim is to be the master of your mind and not the other way around.

Here are some actual concrete examples I encountered when learning new skills:

1. *Juggling* - When learning Juggling, you throw the first ball in the air and let it fall down on the other hand but momentarily, after you launch the first ball, you need to throw the second ball in the other hand also in the air - but your brain is so hard-wired to panic about catching the (first) ball in air, that you quickly transfer the second ball to the other hand through a side-swipe so you can empty your hand to catch the first ball when it comes down. But you'll never get to juggle them if you do that! It is only through constant and patient practice while understanding the reason for panicking can you break out it.

2. *Swimming* - As an adult learning to swim, I find it quite automatic to tense up when I enter water. My muscles tense up which actually helps you sink faster instead of making you swim! It takes quite a bit of mental calisthenics to stay calm and relaxed so you can learn how to swim.

3. *Motorcycling* - When cornering at high speeds, you are expected to "push down" on the bike - slant the bike from its vertical position in the direction you are cornering to get better ground clearance and to make a smooth turn without having to reduce the throttle. Even though motorbikes are design to bend up to a 45 degree angle (and more) at motorcycle speeds, it is very hard to not feel like your bike is going to skid underneath you and to force that motion while cornering. Again, this makes a tremendous difference and actually helps you negotiate sharp corners safely without entering into oncoming traffic on the other lane. Similarly, when you encounter a hazard on the road, our natural tendency to focus on the hazard and not look away makes it harder to avoid the hazard.


There are a couple of tips to be gleaned from all the above cases - Identify the behavior that is holding you back. Focus on your goal behavior and distract yourself from the natural behavior which you would like to avoid.

Doing so is magical! Suddenly, you realise you can juggle or swim or ride motorcycles! The same applies to many day-to-day events whether it is getting angry, not understanding you were wrong and changing your opinion etc., 

It does not help to feel guilty about your "default setting" but thinking about it objectively can help you with reaching your goal behavior.
