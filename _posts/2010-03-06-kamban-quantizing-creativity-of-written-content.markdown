title: Kamban - A simple tool for measuring creativity of written content
layout: post

I wrote a paper to describe a novel creativity metric to assign a score specifying how creative a piece of written text is and Kamban is a tool that implements this metric. This metric is based on the intuitive and common sense notion that the more varied the things referred by the text, the more creative it is and the fact that boring, droll text only talk about very few things and using common place words. Wikipedia is used as the primary source of knowledge of the words in the text by cross-referencing the categorization details given for that word in its page.
