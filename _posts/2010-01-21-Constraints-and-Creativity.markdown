Constraints, to me, is a very interesting topic. From the past, I’ve seen through my experiences, the (good) effect  constraints have.

You know what they say – If it does not break you, it makes you stronger.

I would like to hear about what you think are some examples of the formal constraints that shape art.

1. Iambic Pentameter (to create sonnets) – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iambic_pentameter

2. Venpa – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venpa one of the many tamil poetic forms and expressible as a context free grammar!

3. Mathematics!

4. Programming

5. Western Classical music – (as i understand) music is not playing any random frequency, but choosing from 12 frequencies (monochormatic scale) and their octaves. Even in this, a piece of music is usually made up of only a subset of these frequencies… (pentatonic, ditonic)… It is interesting to note that major scales give a happy feel and the minor ones give a sad feel!

Overall – I believe that constraints are not stifling, but give a grounding for expression.
